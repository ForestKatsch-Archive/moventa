      <p>Moventa is basically a way to host short and high quality short videos
	without the 256 color limit that have haunted GIF. Moventa is not
	intended to be a replacement for GIF as it is not a file format but a hosting service.</p>

	<h1>Why not GIF?</h1>
      </header>
      <p>First off, moventa is <em>not</em> a replacement for GIF. It is only a
	service that hosts high quality short videos. That said, GIF is limited to 256 distinct
	colors, which makes it badly suited for skin tones or clips in which the color palette
	changes. Moventa uses the PNG image format as its foundation to ensure
	accurate color, with support for 16 million individual colors and efficient compression.</p>
